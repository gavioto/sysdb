        SysDB -- a system management and inventory collection service
       ===============================================================

  “System DataBase” (SysDB) is a multi-backend system management and inventory
  collection service. It may be used to (continuously) collect information
  about your systems from various backends (inventory services, monitoring
  services, etc.) and provides a unique interface to access the information
  independent of the active backends. This is done by storing and mapping the
  backend objects to generic objects and correlating the attributes to create
  a single hierarchical view of your infrastructure.

  SysDB is free and open source software, licensed under the 2-clause BSD
  license. See COPYING for details.

Prerequisites
-------------

  To compile the SysDB package from source you need:

  * A build environment: autotools, libtool, C compiler, ...

    <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
    <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/>
    <http://gcc.gnu.org/>

  * When building from Git, you also need the flex lexical analyzer generator
    and bison parser generator (other lex and yacc compatible tools might work
    as well if you are lucky).

    <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>
    <http://flex.sourceforge.net/>

  * A POSIX + Single UNIX Specification compatible C library.

    <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/>

  * asciidoc, xsltproc, xmlto:
    The AsciiDoc text document format is used to write the manpages.

    <http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/>
    <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>
    <https://fedorahosted.org/xmlto/>

  * libedit or libreadline:
    A readline compatible command line editor and history library is used for
    handling input in the sysdb client program.

    <http://thrysoee.dk/editline/>
    <http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html>

  The following optional libraries may be used by various plugins:

  * libdbi:
    The database independent abstraction layer is used for database access by
    the puppet::store-configs plugin.

    <http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/>

Testing
-------

  Unit tests for SysDB are shipped along with the source code in the ‘t’
  subdirectory. Run ‘make test’ to run all available tests.

  Some tests require the ‘fopencookie’ function as provided by the GNU libc
  library. It used used to mock I/O related functions. In case this function
  is not available, the respective tests will be disabled automatically.

  Code coverage testing using Gcov may be enabled when using the
  ‘--enable-gcov’ configure option.

Configuring / Compiling / Installing
------------------------------------

  To configure, build and install SysDB with the default settings, run
  ‘./configure && make && make install’. For detailed, generic instructions
  see INSTALL. For a complete list of configure options and their description,
  run ‘./configure --help’.

  By default, SysDB will be installed into ‘/opt/sysdb’. You can adjust this
  setting by specifying the ‘--prefix’ configure option - see INSTALL for
  details. If you pass DESTDIR=<path> to ‘make install’, <path> will be
  prefixed to all installation directories. This might be useful when creating
  packages for SysDB.
