        SysDB -- a system management and inventory collection service
       ===============================================================

  “System DataBase” (SysDB) is a multi-backend system management and inventory
  collection service. It stores system and inventory information about
  hardware and software systems. This information is (continuously) collected
  from various configurable backends (inventory services, monitoring services,
  etc.) and stored in a graph-like hierarchy of generic objects. The store may
  be queried through a generic interface independent of the active backends.
  Object names are canonicalized before they are added to the store to ensure
  a consistent view of your infrastructure.

  The central object type is a host, which generally represents a physical or
  virtual machine or any other type of physical resource. Hosts, in turn, may
  reference a list of services which represent any kind of logical resource
  like a software system. Both, hosts and services, may reference a list of
  attributes which represent further information about the respective host or
  service object. For example, attributes may specify static information like
  a host's architecture or the software version or reference performance data
  like the current memory utilization or much more.

  SysDB is free and open source software, licensed under the 2-clause BSD
  license. See COPYING for details. Changes between all SysDB releases can be
  found in the file ReleaseNotes.

Configure and install SysDB
---------------------------

  To configure, build and install SysDB with the default settings, run
  ‘./configure && make && make install’. For detailed, generic instructions
  see INSTALL. For a complete list of configure options and their description,
  run ‘./configure --help’.

  Various third-party packages are required for a full installation of SysDB.
  See the section ‘Prerequisites’ below for details. A summary of
  user-supplied and auto-detected build settings is displayed at the end of
  each ‘configure’ run. Consult this first for trouble-shooting.

  By default, SysDB will be installed into ‘/opt/sysdb’. You can adjust this
  setting by specifying the ‘--prefix’ configure option - see INSTALL for
  details. If you pass DESTDIR=<path> to ‘make install’, <path> will be
  prefixed to all installation directories. This might be useful when creating
  packages for SysDB.

Prerequisites
-------------

  To compile the SysDB package from source you need:

  * A build environment: autotools, libtool, C compiler, ...

    <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
    <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/>
    <http://gcc.gnu.org/>

  * When building from Git, you also need the flex lexical analyzer generator
    and bison parser generator (other lex and yacc compatible tools might work
    as well if you are lucky).

    <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>
    <http://flex.sourceforge.net/>

  * A POSIX + Single UNIX Specification compatible C library.

    <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/>

  * asciidoc, xsltproc, xmlto:
    The AsciiDoc text document format is used to write the manpages.

    <http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/>
    <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>
    <https://fedorahosted.org/xmlto/>

  * libedit or libreadline:
    A readline compatible command line editor and history library is used for
    handling input in the sysdb client program.

    <http://thrysoee.dk/editline/>
    <http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html>

  The following optional libraries may be used by various plugins:

  * libdbi:
    The database independent abstraction layer is used for database access by
    the puppet::store-configs plugin.

    <http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/>

Testing
-------

  Unit and integration tests for SysDB are shipped along with the source code
  in the ‘t’ subdirectory. Run ‘make test’ to run all available tests.

  Some tests require the ‘fopencookie’ function as provided by the GNU libc
  library. It used used to mock I/O related functions. In case this function
  is not available, the respective tests will be disabled automatically.

  The integration tests require valgrind. If it is not available, integration
  tests will be disabled automatically.

  For the latest build status, see:
  <https://travis-ci.org/tokkee/sysdb>

  Code coverage testing using Gcov may be enabled when using the
  ‘--enable-gcov’ configure option.
