        SysDB -- a system management and inventory collection service
       ===============================================================

  “System DataBase” (SysDB) is a multi-backend system management and inventory
  collection service. It may be used to (continuously) collect information
  about your systems from various backends (inventory services, monitoring
  services, etc.) and provides a unique interface to access the information
  independent of the active backends. This is done by storing and mapping the
  backend objects to generic objects and correlating the attributes to create
  a single hierarchical view of your infrastructure.

  SysDB is free and open source software, licensed under the 2-clause BSD
  license. See COPYING for details.

Prerequisites
-------------

  To compile the SysDB package from source you need:

  * A build environment: autotools, libtool, C compiler, ...

  * When building from Git, you also need the flex lexical analyzer generator
    and bison parser generator (other lex and yacc compatible tools might work
    as well if you are lucky).

  * A POSIX + Single UNIX Specification compatible C library.

  * asciidoc, xsltproc, xmlto:
    The AsciiDoc text document format is used to write the manpages.

Configuring / Compiling / Installing
------------------------------------

  To configure, build and install SysDB with the default settings, run
  `./configure && make && make install'. For detailed, generic instructions
  see INSTALL. For a complete list of configure options and their description,
  run `./configure --help'.

  By default, SysDB will be installed into `/opt/sysdb'. You can adjust this
  setting by specifying the `--prefix' configure option - see INSTALL for
  details. If you pass DESTDIR=<path> to `make install', <path> will be
  prefixed to all installation directories. This might be useful when creating
  packages for SysDB.
