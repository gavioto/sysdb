     syscollector -- a system management / inventory collection service
    ====================================================================

  “System Collector” (syscollector) is a multi-backend system management and
  inventory collection service. It may be used to collect information from
  various backends (inventory services, monitoring services, etc.) and
  provides a unique interface to access the information independent of the
  active backends. This is done by mapping the backend objects to generic
  objects and correlating the attributes to create a single hierarchy of your
  infrastructure.

  This is free and open source software, licensed under the 2-clause BSD
  license. See COPYING for details.

Prerequisites
-------------

  To compile the syscollector package from source you need:

  * A build environment: autotools, libtool, C compiler, ...

  * A POSIX + Single UNIX Specification compatible C library.

  * asciidoc, xsltproc:
    The AsciiDoc text document format is used to write the manpages.

Configuring / Compiling / Installing
------------------------------------

  To configure, build and install syscollector with the default settings, run
  `./configure && make && make install'. For detailed, generic instructions
  see INSTALL. For a complete list of configure options and their description,
  run `./configure --help'.

  By default, syscollector will be installed into `/opt/syscollector'. You can
  adjust this setting by specifying the `--prefix' configure option - see
  INSTALL for details. If you pass DESTDIR=<path> to `make install', <path>
  will be prefixed to all installation directories. This might be useful when
  creating packages for syscollector.
