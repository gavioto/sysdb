SysDB requires all client connections to a database server to be
authenticated. The following authentication mechanism are supported at this
time:

*Peer authentication for UNIX domain socket connections*::
	Connections via UNIX domain sockets are authenticated by obtaining the
	client's operating system user name from the kernel. The name has to match
	the username used to connect to the server.

*SSL certificate authentication for TCP connection*::
	SSL client certificates will be used to authenticate TCP connections. The
	'cn' (common name) attribute of the certificate has to match the username
	used to connect to the server.
	Note that full client and server verification is currently enforced on all
	TCP connections.
