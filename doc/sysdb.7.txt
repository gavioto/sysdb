NAME
----
sysdb - the System DataBase (SysDB)

SYNOPSIS
--------

  sysdbd -C /path/to/sysdbd.conf

  sysdb -H /path/to/sysdbd.sock

DESCRIPTION
-----------
include::sysdb-description.txt[]

SysDB is made up of several components:

sysdbd
~~~~~~
The SysDB daemon acts as the data collection instance and database server. It
collects system and inventory information from the backends and aggregates
objects retrieved from different backends based on their attributes. This way,
it creates a uniform hierarchy of the entire infrastructure.

For details about the SysDB daemon, see its manual page manpage:sysdbd[1].

sysdb
~~~~~
The SysDB client is a terminal-based, interactive shell which may be used to
query the SysDB daemon. It connects to a running daemon and then accepts
commands from the user, sends them to the server, and displays the results.

For details about the SysDB client, see its manual page manpage:sysdb[1]. For
details about how to query the database, see the specification of the SysDB
query language in manpage:sysdbql[7].
