NAME
----
sysdbd - system management and inventory collection service

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sysdbd* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sysdbd* is a multi-backend system management and inventory collection daemon.
It stores system and inventory information about hardware and software
systems. This information is (continuously) collected from various
configurable backends.

The main daemon itself is the central instance managing all collected
information and doing the correlation of objects provided by different
backends. It basically acts as a database server. All data retrieval, any
further processing, storing and exporting of data is done by plugins.

OPTIONS
-------
*sysdbd* accepts the following command-line options.

*-C* '<file>'::
	The main configuration file. This file defines the behavior of *sysdbd* by
	specifying default settings and the plugins to be loaded.

*-D*::
	Do not daemonize on startup: Rather than starting *sysdbd* as a background
	process detached from the current terminal and session (the default), run
	the process in the foreground. This allows easy monitoring of *sysdbd*.

*-h*::
	Display a usage and help summary and exit.

*-V*::
	Display the version number and copyright information.

SIGNALS
-------

*sysdbd* accepts and handles the following signals:

*SIGINT*, *SIGTERM*::
	These signals initiate a clean shutdown and termination of the daemon.

*SIGHUP*::
	This signal causes the daemon to re-read the configuration and reconfigure
	all plugins. Plugins which are no longer in use will be disabled and
	unloaded. Open client connections are not affected by this.

EXIT CODES
----------
*0*::
	Success.

*1*::
	Failure (syntax or usage error).

BUGS
----
None known.
