NAME
----
sysdbd - system management and inventory collection service

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sysdbd* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sysdbd* is a multi-backend system management and inventory collection daemon.
It may be used to (continuously) collect information from various backends
(e.g., inventory services, monitoring services, configuration services) and
provides a uniform combined view of all data.

The main daemon itself is the central instance managing all collected
information and doing the correlation of objects provided by different
backends. It basically acts as a database server. All data retrieval, any
further processing, storing and exporting of data is done by plugins.

OPTIONS
-------
*sysdbd* accepts the following command-line options.

*-C* '<file>'::
	The main configuration file. This file defines the behavior of *sysdbd* by
	specifying default settings and the plugins to be loaded.

*-D*::
	Do not daemonize on startup: Rather than starting *sysdbd* as a background
	process detached from the current terminal and session (the default), run
	the process in the foreground. This allows easy monitoring of *sysdbd*.

*-h*::
	Display a usage and help summary and exit.

*-V*::
	Display the version number and copyright information.

EXIT CODES
----------
*0*::
	Success.

*1*::
	Failure (syntax or usage error).

BUGS
----
None known.
