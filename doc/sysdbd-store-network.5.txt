DESCRIPTION
-----------
*store::network* is a plugin which connects to a remote SysDB instance and
sends all locally collected stored objects to that instance. It uses the
low-level binary protocol to efficiently transmit the data.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
*store::network* accepts the following configuration options:

*Server* '<address>'::
	A server block specifies the connection settings. Multiple servers may be
	specified to send all data to multiple instances. The specified
	'<address>' may be a local path-name of a UNIX domain socket, a hostname,
	an IPv4 address, or and IPv6 address along with the remote port, separated
	by a colon (":").
	+
	All TCP connections are encrypted with SSL/TLS. See the *SSL*
	configuration options for details about how to configure this.
	+
	All clients need to authenticate against the remote SysDB instance. See
	the section *AUTHENTICATION* for details.
	+
	A server block accepts the following configuration options:

	*Username* '<name>';;
		The username used for authentication against the remote instance.

	*SSLCertificate* '<filename>';;
		The SSL certificate file to use for SSL connections and
		authentication.

	*SSLCertificateKey* '<filename>';;
		The SSL private key file to use for SSL connections and
		authentication.

	*SSLCACertificates* '<filename>';;

		certificate verification to use for SSL connection.
