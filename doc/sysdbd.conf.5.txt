DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *sysdbd.conf* file controls the behavior of the system management and
inventory collection daemon (*sysdbd*). As the daemon itself does not provide
any real (user-facing) functionality, the most important part of the
configuration is loading and configuring plugins.

The syntax of this configuration file is similar to that of the Apache
webserver. It is made up of _options_ and _sections_. Each option contains a
_key_ and one or more _values_ separated by spaces and terminated by a newline
character. Sections are enclosed in a start- and end-tag, each on a line of
their own. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets and also contain a key
and value. Section end-tags only contain the key of the start-tag prepended by
a forward-slash ("/"). Empty lines are ignored as well as any unquoted hash
symbol ("#") including anything following up to the following newline. Keys
are unquoted strings consisting only of alphanumeric characters and the
underscore character ("_"). Values may either be unquoted strings, quoted
strings enclosed in double quotes, numbers or boolean values (*true* or
*false*). In order to include a double-quote character in a quoted string,
escape it using a backslash character ("\"). Floating point numbers use a dot
(".") as decimal separator.

Lines may be wrapped by using a backslash character ("\") as the last
character before the newline. This allows long lines to be split into multiple
lines. Quoted strings may be wrapped as well. However, those are treated
special in that whitespace at the beginning of the following lines will be
ignored, which allows for nicely indenting the wrapped lines.

GLOBAL SETTINGS
---------------
*sysdbd* accepts the following global options:

*Interval* '<seconds>'::
	Sets the interval at which to query backends by default. The interval is
	specified in seconds and might be a floating-point value. This option will
	be used by any "active" backend, that is, those that actively query some
	external system rather than receiving some stream of events.

*LoadBackend* '<name>'::
	Loads the backend named '<name>'. Backends are special plugins taking care
	of collecting values from external systems. This may optionally be a
	section containing any of the following options:

	*Interval* '<seconds>';;
		Overwrite the global interval setting by setting a custom interval to
		be used for this backend. See the global *Interval* option for more
		details.

PLUGINS
-------
Some plugins support additional configuration options. Each of these are
enclosed in a *Plugin* or *Backend* section. The following plugins are shipped
with SysDB. See *sysdb*-'<name>'(5) manpages for more details.

*collectd::unixsock*::
This backend module accesses the system statistics collection daemon
*collectd* through its UNIX socket interface. It periodically queries all host
and service information.
+
See also: http://collectd.org

*mk-livestatus*::
This backend modules accesses monitoring systems supporting the *livestatus*
addon (e.g., *Nagios*, *Icinga*, and *Shinken*). It periodically queries all
host and service information.
+
See also: http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html,
http://www.nagios.org/, http://icinga.org/, http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/

*puppet::store-configs*::
This backend module accesses the configuration management system *Puppet*
through its *store configs* database. It periodically queries all host and
facter facts information storing the latter as host attributes.
+
See also: http://puppetlabs.com/puppet,
http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/facter/

*syslog*::
This logging module sends log messages of the daemon and plugins to the local
system's syslog service.
