“System DataBase” (SysDB) is a multi-backend system management and inventory
collection service. It stores system and inventory information about hardware
and software systems. This information is (continuously) collected from
various configurable backends (inventory services, monitoring services, etc.)
and stored in a graph-like hierarchy of generic objects. The store may be
queried through a generic interface independent of the active backends. Object
names are canonicalized before they are added to the store to ensure a
consistent view of your infrastructure.

The central object type is a host, which generally represents a physical or
virtual machine or any other type of physical resource. Hosts, in turn, may
reference a list of services which represent any kind of logical resource like
a software system. Both, hosts and services, may reference a list of
attributes which represent further information about the respective host or
service object. For example, attributes may specify static information like a
host's architecture or the software version. A host may also reference a list
of metrics which are references to performance data stored about the host.
SysDB supports querying the respective time-series from a backend's data
store.
