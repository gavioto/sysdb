SysDB stores system and inventory information about hardware and software
systems. This information is stored in a graph-like hierarchy of generic
objects. The central object type is a host, which generally represents a
physical or virtual machine or any other type of physical resource. Hosts, in
turn, may reference a list of services which represent any kind of logical
resource like a software system. Both, hosts and services, may reference a
list of attributes which represent further information about the respective
host or service object. For example, attributes may specify static information
like a host's architecture or the software version or snapshots of performance
data like the current memory utilization or much more.
