 About SysDB:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  “System DataBase” (SysDB) is a multi-backend system management and inventory
  collection service. It may be used to (continuously) collect information
  about your systems from various backends (inventory services, monitoring
  services, etc.) and provides a unique interface to access the information
  independent of the active backends.

Version 0.1.0, Release Date: tbd
--------------------------------

  This is the initial release of SysDB. It provides the following core
  features:

   * sysdb: A terminal-based, interactive client program. Supports
     line-editing and history based on libreadline or libedit and uses an
     asynchronous, event-driven architecture to handle user input and server
     replies simultaneously.
   * sysdbd: The database backend service configurable through a configuration
     file. The daemon supports online reconfiguration.
   * core: Flexible, multi-threaded core architecture providing a configurable
     plugin infrastructure for querying external data-sources and extending
     core functionality. The following plugin types are supported:
     - data collection
     - hostname canonicalization
     - logging
   * store: Central, in-memory object store managing host and service objects
     and their attributes. Host names may be canonicalized through respective
     plugins. Each object is automatically attributed with last update and
     interval information using nano-seconds resolution. Attributes may have
     various types (integer, decimal, string, date-time, binary).
   * frontend: The frontend handling client connections uses a multi-threaded,
     asynchronous, event-driven architecture capable of handling multiple
     listen addresses.
   * query language: The store may be queried using the ‘LIST’, ‘LOOKUP’, and
     ‘FETCH’ commands returning JSON formatted objects.
   * documentation: Full documentation for the tools, all plugins, and the
     query language provided as manpages and HTML pages.
   * testing: Unit and integration tests exist for most parts except plugins
     covering 77% of all functions. Valgrind and Clang's address sanitzer are
     used to detect memory leaks and programming errors.

  The following plugins are shipped with this version of SysDB:

  Backends:
   * collectd::unixsock: Query collectd through its ‘unixsock’ interface
   * mk-livestatus: Query arbitrary (monitoring) systems using the Check_MK
     Livestatus interface.
   * puppet::store-configs: Query Puppet through its “stored configuration”
     database.

  Plugins:
   * cname::dns: Canonicalize hostnames by querying DNS information.
   * syslog: Send log messages to the system log service.
